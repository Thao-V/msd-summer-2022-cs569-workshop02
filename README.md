* SignIn component: Contains the form to login to the system. When the user logged in successfully, it will navigate to the student module and the token will be saved in `localstorage`
* SignUp: is a form to register a new user. When a user is register successfully, it will navigate to the login page
### Student Module: Implement routes and the following components
* StudentList: list all students
* AddNewStudent: add a new student
* UpdateStudent: update an existing student
### App Module
* App component shows the student module in the case there is a token in `localstorage`. Otherwises, it shows the auth module

* Implement an interceptor to support sending the token in the request header if exists.
